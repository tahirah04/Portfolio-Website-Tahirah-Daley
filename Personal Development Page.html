        <h1>Personal Development</h1>
        <h2>“Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener </h2>
    </center>
    <p> Chapters 4 through 7 of “Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, present a fictional narrative featuring a conversation between two characters, Michael and Charlie, who converse about various aspects of the importance of personal development, goal-setting, success and the impact of associations on personal growth.</p>
    <p> "Achieve Your Goals," the fourth chapter, discusses achieving one's goals and emphasizes the importance of setting clear goals as well as their influence on personal development and fulfillment. Charlie shares the guidance he received from Mr. Davis, who states that setting goals makes individuals define their goals and by writing them down, makes them tangible and attainable. 
        Charlie further explains that the real reason for writing down goals is what it makes of the person, rather than just achieving the goal itself. This chapter challenges readers to consider the importance of goal-setting and the role it plays in defining one's sense of direction and purpose in life. For example, goal-setting is a useful method for many individuals to remain concentrated and motivated in achieving their goals. 
        This is a lesson I can apply to my life as I often consider the goals I want to accomplish but seldom the means by which I will do it, which prevents me from accomplishing many of my goals. Implementing the practice of writing down my goals, could be an eye-opening exercise that provides me with a more distinct sense of purpose.</p>
    <p>Chapter 5, "The Proper Use of Time," delves into the importance of time management, utilizing time wisely and concentrating on tasks that support one's long-term objectives. Charlie clarifies the concept of the pain of discipline versus the pain of regret, stating that “discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons,” as Michael struggles to strike a balance between job and family life. 
        Charlie continues by emphasizing that there are multiple opportunities every day; the secret is to seize the most important ones and avoid letting urgent matters control you. Chapter 5 is a reminder to prioritize tasks that will help in your personal development. People should assess their daily routines to ensure they are devoting time to pursuits that promote personal development and fulfillment, as it is easy to become engrossed in the thick of things. 
        This is another important lesson I can apply to my life. I tend to focus more on urgent matters than ones that are crucial to my long-term goals, so I would have to evaluate how I spend my time every day and attempt to implement effective time management so that I can set aside time for activities that contribute to my professional and personal development.</p>
    <p>Chapter 6, “Surround Yourself with the Best People,” covers how your success can be influenced by the associations in your life, whether it be friends, spouse, co-workers or family. Charlie highlights the significance of choosing the right associations and the influence they have on success and personal growth and so encourages Michael to evaluate his friendships and associations carefully, questioning whether his friends are promoting or impeding his personal development. 
        Charlie encourages Michael to either detach or minimize negative influences and instead pursue connections with individuals who will foster personal development, by presenting the notion that successful people surround themselves with those who challenge and inspire them. Chapter 6 implores individuals to be mindful of the associations they keep and the impact they may have on their success. This is crucial as a person's character, attitude, and goals may be impacted by unfavourable associations. 
        Using this insight to assess my associations, I could determine whether they promote development or stagnation. Instead of clinging to associations that perpetuate complacency, it would require me to be more deliberate about the company I keep and surround myself with people who inspire, support and encourage my growth.</p>
    <p>By chapter 7, “Be a Life-Long Learner,” the conversation emphasizes the importance of being a habitual learner for development. By telling Michael that ‘Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune,’ Charlie emphasizes the value of self-education. He encourages Michael to read books as they are an effective means of personal development and so tasks him to read a book before their next meeting. 
        As self-education is a major factor in success and prosperity in life, Chapter 7 exhorts readers to embrace lifelong learning, leverage the power of books, and pursue knowledge. This is an insight I already apply in life as I am someone who reads a lot. No matter how much formal education I complete, nothing can beat the value of self-education, as it allows me to learn from others and see from a different perspective.</p>
