        <p>Growing up, I didn’t have the stereotypical childhood dream of being a doctor or a teacher. Instead, my vision was shaped by my experiences and passions over time. For a while, I wasn’t sure what career path I wanted to follow, but during my time at St. Andrew High School for Girls, <br> I discovered my love for the arts—specifically, visual arts. Through this medium, I found a new way to express myself and bring my imagination to life.
            My passion for animation, however, started long before that. As a child, I was mesmerized by animated films, captivated by the way stories and characters came to life on screen. The mechanics of animation fascinated me, and the more I researched, the more intrigued I became. <br>As such, I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Animation Development and Production at the University of Technology, Jamaica.</p>
