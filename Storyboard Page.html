        <h2> Themes and Features</h2>
    </center>
    <p>The use of blue and orange, along with white text, was strategically chosen to enhance visual appeal and readability.</p> 
    <p>The colour blue gives a trusting, professional feel which I thought would be perfect for a portfolio website. It also gives a modern and tech-friendly feel, which would make the site look polished. The orange contrasts well with the blue, allowing aspects of the website to stand out. This in turn would grab the attention of users. The white text on a dark background is for readability, as well as it creates a clean, modern, and professional look.
        The intended target audience for this website would be individuals 18 years and up. This website will feature pictures, gifs and a slideshow.</p>
