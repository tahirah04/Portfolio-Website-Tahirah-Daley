        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <h2>Strongest Trait, Emotion and Hobby Impact on Academics</h2>
    </center>
    <p>My creative mindset, determination and graphic design skills play a significant role in shaping my academic journey. These qualities not only enhance my coursework but also allow me to approach challenges with innovation and resilience.</p>
    <p>My creative thinking allows me to think outside the box when completing class assignments and projects. Whether it's designing engaging presentations or
        conceptualizing unique ideas for coursework, creativity allows me to communicate my thoughts effectively which is crucial for my course of study.
        My determination to excel no matter the obstacles that come my way, fuels my ability to continue to persevere and tackle difficult coursework and continually improve my skills. When faced with difficult tasks, I push through and find creative ways to solve them rather than give up.
        Graphic design allows me to continue enhancing my creative skills and create visually appealing products. My portfolio website project a representation of these skills.</p>

        <h2>Role Model</h2>
    </center>
    <p>My hero would be my mother as she has guided me throughout life and taught me valuable lessons to aid me in my development as a young woman. She lives by a quote that I have also taken as my own - "No matter the struggle, never forget God." 
        This quote has been with me for as long as I can remember and it resonates because, I have seen her gone through many hardships and tribulations and no matter the obstacle that came her way, she never gave up or forgot God. She is a hardworking, caring and loving woman and if anyone deserves to be called a hero, it should definitely be her. </p>

    <p>Personality tests can vary in validity, depending on their structure and the context in which they are applied. Some tests are well-structured, that could be considered reliable, however, these tests might fail to account for complex human behaviours, which could lead to generalized results. The main issue of using personality tests is the potential for inaccuracy. 
        Personality tests frequently rely on self-reported information, which is prone to biases and inaccuracies since people may attempt to present themselves in a more positive light. 
        In my case, the test identified some aspects of my personality, so I would say it has some level of validity. Personality tests are a good way to get insights into one's self, but shouldn't be used to determine who you are as a person.</p>
